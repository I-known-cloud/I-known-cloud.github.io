      National First Prize
      In the National College Student Mathematical Modeling Competition of the Higher Education Society Cup, C questions are usually biased towards the study of mechanism analysis and planning problems. Question C in 2023 is dedicated to solving the problem of pricing and replenishment of vegetable products in supermarkets. In this project, the Spearman correlation analysis model was used to find out the interrelationship between vegetable commodities. The gray forecast model with short-term forecasting is then used to derive the sales trend for the coming week. On this basis, a linear approximate beam optimization model is established, and the sum of the total purchases of each vegetable category in the next week and the next day in the problem, as well as the relevant function expressions and constraints, are calculated to find the sales and wholesale price of each single product, and the sensitivity test of the model is carried out to verify its stability.
